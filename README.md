Module turtle - Creation of the flag of Tunisia

The flag of Tunisia is a rectangular panel of red color with an aspect ratio of 2:3. In the center of the cloth in a white circle is placed a red crescent, surrounding a red five-pointed star on three sides. Bey Tunisia Hussein II decided to create a flag for Tunisia, close in appearance to the modern one, after the Battle of Navarino on 20 October 1827; in 1831 he was officially approved. In this form, the flag existed during the French protectorate, and on 1 June 1959, it was proclaimed the state flag of the Republic of Tunisia (in accordance with the country's constitution). On 30 June 1999, the proportions and design of the flag were clarified by a special law; the general appearance of the flag remained virtually unchanged.

The crescent and star depicted on the flag of Tunisia are traditional symbols of Islam, and are also considered symbols of good luck.
